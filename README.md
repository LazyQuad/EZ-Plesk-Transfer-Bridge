# EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge

## Overview

EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge is a set of bash scripts designed to facilitate the migration of Plesk domains between servers using a bridge (intermediary) server. This approach offers several advantages in specific scenarios.

## Why Use a Bridge Server?

1. **Firewall Restrictions**: When direct communication between the source and target servers is restricted due to firewall rules, a bridge server can act as an intermediary to transfer data.

2. **Network Segmentation**: In environments where the source and target servers are on different network segments or VLANs, a bridge server can provide a way to transfer data across these boundaries.

3. **Bandwidth Optimization**: A strategically placed bridge server can optimize data transfer speeds, especially when the source and target servers are geographically distant.

4. **Centralized Control**: Using a bridge server allows for centralized control and logging of the migration process, which can be beneficial for auditing and monitoring.

5. **Proxy Functionality**: In cases where direct access to either the source or target server is not possible, a bridge server can serve as a proxy to facilitate the migration.

## Security Considerations

- This script relies on SSH for secure communication between servers.
- It uses password-based authentication, which may not be suitable for all security environments.
- The security of the migration process depends on the proper configuration and hardening of the bridge server.
- While using a bridge server can provide centralized control and logging, it also introduces an additional point in the data transfer process that needs to be secured.
- Users should ensure that all servers involved (source, target, and bridge) are properly secured according to best practices.

## Scripts

### 1. EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge-Basic

A streamlined script for basic Plesk domain migrations using a bridge server. It covers essential functionality including:

- SSH connection checks
- Plesk version verification
- Domain backup and restore
- Basic error handling and logging

### 2. EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge-Pro

An advanced version of the migration script with additional features:

- Configuration file support
- Dry run mode
- SSL certificate migration
- Verbose logging
- Component-specific migration options

### 3. Log Cleaner

A utility script to manage log files generated by the migration scripts:

- Delete logs older than a specified number of days
- Option to delete all logs
- Customizable log directory
