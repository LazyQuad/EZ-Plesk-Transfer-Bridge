# Plesk Migration Script Configuration
#
# SECURITY WARNING:
# This configuration file may contain sensitive information, including passwords.
# It is strongly recommended that you:
#  1. Do NOT store actual passwords in this file in a production environment.
#  2. Use appropriate file permissions to restrict access to this file.
#  3. Consider using environment variables or a secure password manager for credentials.
#  4. Never share this file or commit it to version control systems.
#
# The inclusion of passwords in this file is for convenience in controlled environments only.
# Use at your own risk and replace with more secure methods in production scenarios.
#
# USAGE NOTE:
# This configuration file is optional. The migration script can be run without it,
# in which case it will prompt for necessary information interactively.
# To use this file, ensure it's named 'migration_config.conf' and placed in the same
# directory as the script, or specify its path using the --config option.
#
# Example: ./migration_script.sh --config /path/to/your/config.conf
#
# If you prefer not to use a config file, simply run the script without any arguments,
# and it will guide you through the process interactively.

#Any fields left blank and/or not addressed by a CLI option will be prompted for.
