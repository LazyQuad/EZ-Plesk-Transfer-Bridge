# EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge Log Cleaner

## Overview

The Log Cleaner is a utility script designed to manage log files generated by the EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge scripts. It provides options to delete old log files based on age or to remove all logs.

## Features

- Delete log files older than a specified number of days
- Option to delete all log files
- Customizable log directory

## Usage

1. Ensure the script is in the same directory as your EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge scripts.
2. Make the script executable:
   chmod +x log_cleaner.sh
3. Run the script with desired options:
   ./log_cleaner.sh [OPTIONS]

### Command-line Options

- `-d, --days NUMBER`: Delete log files older than NUMBER days (default: 30)
- `-a, --all`: Delete all log files
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

## Examples

1. Delete logs older than 30 days (default behavior):
   ./log_cleaner.sh

2. Delete logs older than 7 days:
   ./log_cleaner.sh --days 7

3. Delete all log files:
   ./log_cleaner.sh --all

4. Show help message:
   ./log_cleaner.sh --help

## Log Directory

By default, the script looks for log files in a `logs` subdirectory within the script's directory. Ensure your EZ-Plesk-Transfer-Bridge scripts are configured to save logs in this location.

## Customization

You can modify the `LOG_DIR` variable in the script if your log files are stored in a different location.

## Caution

- This script permanently deletes log files. Use with caution.
- Consider backing up important logs before running this script.
- Running the script with the `--all` option will delete all log files, regardless of their age.

## Automation

You can set up this script to run automatically using a cron job. For example, to run it weekly:

1. Open your crontab:
   crontab -e

2. Add the following line (adjust the path as needed):
   0 0 \* \* 0 /path/to/log_cleaner.sh

This will run the script every Sunday at midnight.
